It is strongly recommended to limit the bot's follow and unfollow numbers to under 100 a day. The number of posts liked should also be within reasonable human boundaries. No human would like 200 posts in an hour.


=========================================SETUP=========================================
1)Go to instabot/conf/cfg.py and set the username and password.
    Here you will also be able to configure the number of likes per hashtag, the number of users to follow and the number of days that the followed accounts stay followed.

    MIN_LIKES_PER_TAG - the minimum number of posts to like from each hashtag
    MAX_LIKES_PER_TAG - the maximum number of posts to like from each hashtag
    (These 2 values are used to prevent a pattern that can easily be detected by Instagram's bot detection algorithm)

    USERS_TO_FOLLOW - the number of users to follow from today's liked posts in the previous step
    DAYS_TO_UNFOLLOW - the number of days the users from previous step remain followed

2) Go to data/config/hashtags.txt and introduce the hashtags desired, one hashtag on each line. It should look like this:

beauty
cute
fitness
finance
